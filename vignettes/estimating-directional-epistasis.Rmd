# The question
We want to estimate the directional epistasis in a morphological trait between two diverged populations. One way to study directional epistasis is to produce line-cross data. A line-cross consists of a series of crosses between two populations that have diverged via artificial or natural selection, or between inbred lines, to produce a set of standard populations, referred to as derivatives, with specific genetic properties that can be computed from quantitative genetic theory. The two parental populations, P1 and P2, assumed to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, are crossed to produce a first-generation hybrid, the F1. A second series of crosses between F1 individuals produces second-generation hybrids, the F2 population. Backcrosses B1 and B2 are produced by backcrossing the F1 with the two parental populations P1 and P2.

# The `linecross_models` function
## Choice of model
The multilinear model is useful for studying directional epistasis in the divergence of one population from another.

## Choice of reference
Since we want to study directional epistasis between two diverged populations, for this question it makes most sense to have the ancestral population as P1 and use this as the reference. We defined the reference population P1 as the parental population with the smallest trait mean. By doing so, the direction of epistasis corresponds to the effect of allele substitution when selection increases the trait size.

```{r}
mod.multilinear=linecross_models(data=data_test, model="multilinear",reference="P1", maxeval=3)
```
## Computing epistasis factor
Hansen and Wagner (2001) defined a dimensionless epistasis factor that describes the rescaling of genetic effects during subsequent substitutions. In the context of line crosses this corresponds to the factor the predicted value obtained with the model containing only the reference effects (i.e. without epistasis) should be multiplied to obtain the predicted value with epistasis (Bolstad et al. 2023):

```{r}
episfac.p1.p2.multi= 1+ (mod.multilinear$parameters[4]/2)*mod.multilinear$parameters[3]
episfac.p1.p2.multi
```

The epistasis factor is 0<ef<1 corresponding to negative epistasis. This epistasis factor indicates that the P2 phenotype is only 35% of the expected phenotype under an additive model. In other words, epistasis generates a 65% (1 – 0.35) decrease of the effect of allele substitutions compared with the additive model when the trait mean (or the genotype) shifts from P1 to P2. This result also indicates that additive variance in the P2 population is expected to be ca. 12% (0.35^2) of the additive variance observed in the P1 population for this given trait. 

## The `plot_linecross` function

The axes are genotypes (proportion of P1 alleles, denoted 1-S), heterozygosity (the probability that an individual has one P1 and one P2 allele at a locus, denoted H) and phenotypes. The two variables S and H define a two-dimensional genetic-content space, with P1, F1 and P2 at the edges. Using these variables in a regression with the phenotype as the response variable, this triangle becomes a surface where the height gives the genotypic value (i.e. the trait value of each genotype). This surface is a description of a two-dimensional genotype-phenotype map representing the composite (genome wide sum) genetic effects.

```{r,fig.height = 4.2, fig.width = 7, fig.align = "center"}
plot_linecross(output.model=mod.multilinear, data=data_test, theta=-30, phi=20, margins=c(2,2,2,2), col.triangle="gray80")
```

The arguments `theta` and `phi` allow for twisting the orientation of the 3D plot (same as in `persp`) and `col.triangle` determines the colors of the surfance triangle formed by the line-cross analysis. Black dots represent the observed mean for the populations and derivatives and grey dots are the predicted values.

The GP-map exhibits strong negative epistasis from P1 to P2 (i.e., the surface is concave in the S-direction).
